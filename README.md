# Simple Web Video Stats Monitor

Video Stats was originally designed as a simply way for me to see what my Netflix stream was doing. 

### Current features
- Resolution
- Frame Rate (per second)
- Frame Drops (per second)

## Development Contribution Guidelines

- Do NOT include libraries unless absolutely required.
- The Project should maintain current best practice as much as possible.
- Comment your code, all developers know things, some more than others. Comments help others to learn, as well as helping reviewers to understand the problem being addressed

## Local Development Guide

- point it towards `<project folder>/stream-monitor`
- load up any supported page and you should see the monitor come to life ;)
